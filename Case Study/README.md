# Case study on Induction Stove
## Working Principle 
- The Induction Stove consists of a surface usually made of glass under which there is a coiled metal that is called as induction element.
- Induction cooking uses electric currents to directly heat pots and pans through magnetic induction.
- An electric current is passed through a coiled copper wire underneath the cooking surface, which creates a magnetic current throughout the cooking pan to produce heat.

## Microcontroller
- Microcontroller is controlling unit of the system. It Controlles the all operations happening in Induction Stove
## Power Supply
- The powersupply would be the AC 230V Which can be standard distribution of power system in india.
## Rectifier circuit 
- Used for current conversion that is from AC to DC Which used for many system like Microcontroller,Sensor,Display etc. 
## User Entry
- Where user set their timer and heat  to cook the dish they want to do .
## Display
- The Display is used to display the time remaining to cook and user options to slect.
## Voltage and Current Sensing unit
- These sensors check the current and voltage inputs and outputs and sends to microcontroller to protect or necessary actions to take place.
## Temperature Sensor
- It sensese the temperature to Used to measure and set the temperature as per the option given by the user.
## Cooling fan 
- To reduce the heat that is produced while the machine is ON and keep the devices safe from overheat.
## Memory
- To store the Program and data.
## Timer
- Timers are used to set the timing as per the user's option.
## Induction Coil 
- Induction coil is used to produce the required heat.
