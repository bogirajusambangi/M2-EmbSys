# Case study on Induction Stove
## Working Principle 
- The Induction Stove consists of a surface usually made of glass under which there is a coiled metal that is called as induction element.
- Induction cooking uses electric currents to directly heat pots and pans through magnetic induction.
- An electric current is passed through a coiled copper wire underneath the cooking surface, which creates a magnetic current throughout the cooking pan to produce heat.
