# Case study on Induction Stove
## Working Principle 
- The Induction Stove consists of a surface usually made of glass under which there is a coiled metal that is called as induction element.
- Induction cooking uses electric currents to directly heat pots and pans through magnetic induction.
- An electric current is passed through a coiled copper wire underneath the cooking surface, which creates a magnetic current throughout the cooking pan to produce heat.

## Microcontroller
- Microcontroller is controlling unit of the system. It Controlles the all operations happening in Induction Stove
## Power Supply
- The powersupply would be the AC 230V Which can be standard distribution of power system in india.
## Rectifier circuit 
- Used for current conversion that is from AC to DC Which used for many system like Microcontroller,Sensor,Display etc. 
## User Entry
- Where user set their timer and heat  to cook the dish they want to do .
## Display
- The Display is used to display the time remaining to cook and user options to slect.
## Voltage and Current Sensing unit
- These sensors check the current and voltage inputs and outputs and sends to microcontroller to protect or necessary actions to take place.
## Temperature Sensor
- It sensese the temperature to Used to measure and set the temperature as per the option given by the user.
## Cooling fan 
- To reduce the heat that is produced while the machine is ON and keep the devices safe from overheat.
## Memory
- To store the Program and data.
## Timer
- Timers are used to set the timing as per the user's option.
## Induction Coil 
- Induction coil is used to produce the required heat from current.
## Requirements
- When we start any product development before we need to do market analysis and survey because what type of product they are showing interest and problems of existing product to rectify and enable that solutions in our product.
## High Level Requirements
|SL.no| High Level Requirements|
|-----|------------------------|
| 1| Cooking style options|
|2| Timing and Temperature|
|3| Low power consumption|

## Low Level Requirments
|SL.no| Low Level Requirments|
|-----|--------------------------|
|1| Timer Display|
|2| Buttons to change options|
## System Design
- In this phase we create block diagrams,flow charts and select the required components to use and divide into building blocks of our design.
## Sub System Design
- We design each sub system and make it to suitable to our product in this example we consider as heating block, timing block etc.
## Coding
- We code according to our requirments and send to testing and testers test it vigoriously.
## Sub System Testing
- where we check each building block is working fine or not.
## System Testing
- Here we check thefull system to check desired out put is coming or not. Here we check the stove is cooking well and produces desired output or not etc.
## Validation
- Here they check the product is working fine or not and make sure all HLR and LLR are meeting to send mass production.
