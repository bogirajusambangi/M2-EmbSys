# Temperature Monitoring System
* Temperature Monitoring System is industry based application where we have to take care of the temperature. Some of factories they need to maintain the room temperature to get desired output of the product. Temperature Monitoring System observe the temperature of the room and displays temperature in LCD and enables buzzer if temperature matches the given input. If they need to cool or hot the room to get desired output the system turn on  cooler or heater  according to given inputs.

# Components
## Microcontroller
    - This is the heart of the system. It is a clock driven chip where we can manipulate the data according to our requirments.
    - ATMEGA328 Micro controller is an 8-bit, 28-Pin AVR Microcontroller, manufactured by Microchip.
## LCD
    - An electronic device that is used to display data and the message is known as LCD, This is a 16x2 Liquid crystal display.
    - It includes 16 Columns & 2 Rows so it can display 32 characters
## Buzzer
    -  A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which produces a beep sound when it is powered up.
## Temperature sensor
    - A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
    - The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of environmental phenomena.
    - The sensor is used to measure the temperature and it sends analog data to ADC. 
## Actuator
    - An actuator is a device that produces a motion by converting energy and signals going into the system.
    - The motion it produces can be either rotary or linear. 
    - Here the actuator used like a switch to turn on particular component.
