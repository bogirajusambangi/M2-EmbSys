# Temperature Monitoring System
* Temperature Monitoring System is industry based application where we have to take care of the temperature. Some of factories they need to maintain the room temperature to get desired output of the product. Temperature Monitoring System observe the temperature of the room and displays temperature in LCD and enables buzzer if temperature matches the given input. If they need to cool or hot the room to get desired output the system turn on  cooler or heater  according to given inputs.

# Components
## Microcontroller
    - This is the heart of the system. It is a clock driven chip where we can manipulate the data according to our requirments.
## LCD
    - This is a 16x2 Liquid crystal display.It can capable to display 32 characters at a time in constant mode. 
## Buzzer
    - The buzzer is used to go get a beep sound when it is powered up.
## Temperature sensor
    - The sensor is used to measure the temperature and it sends analog data to ADC.
